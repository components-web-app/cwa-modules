# CWA Nuxt 3 Module (in development)

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/components-web-app/cwa-nuxt-module/branch/nuxt3/graph/badge.svg?token=Z6GQJN413O)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/components-web-app/cwa-nuxt-module/tree/nuxt3)

This module is designed to work with the [API Component Bundle](https://github.com/components-web-app/api-components-bundle) and will provide a full user-interface and utilities to easily create custom web apps with an advanced in-line content management system

## CWA Module in Action

### Template using this module for front-end and API Components Bundle for back-end
https://github.com/components-web-app/components-web-app/tree/v3

### Template application deployed online
https://cwa-v3-silverback-web-apps.vercel.app/

## Development

- Run `npm run dev:prepare` to generate type stubs.
- Use `npm run dev` to start [playground](./playground) in development mode.

### Linting

- Run `npm run lint` or `npm run lint:fix`

### Testing

We have built in testing using `vitest`.

- To run tests as a one-off use `npm run test`
- To include coverage run `npm run test:coverage`
- To run tests in watch mode during development run `npm run test:watch`
- If you want to check coverage updates at the same time as watching for file changes you can run `npm run test:watch:coverage`

## Test coverage for branch `nuxt3`

> Please note: Partial line matches are far from accurate due to the test suite's clover report. Although every attempt is made to cover all conditions, code coverage is an indication that a line was hit, but not that the results have been asserted (although every attempt has been made to check for this). If you find a bug, please report it and appropriate tests can be written to harden the code. If you find a test that has not fully covered the functionality expected, please submit a pull request with an updated or new test.
