# CWA Nuxt Module Documentation

>__A Nuxt module to create a Components Web App. Designed to be used with the [API Components Bundle](https://github.com/components-web-app/api-components-bundle) (or any other API implementing the same specification).__

### **[See it in action: Components Web App](https://github.com/components-web-app/components-web-app)**

## Introduction
This module has been designed to provide a "plug-and-play" implementation for the API Components Bundle. You can get started right away with Docker and Kubernetes deployment using the [Components Web App](https://github.com/components-web-app/components-web-app) package of simply include this module in your application.

We chose Nuxt (VueJs with SSR rendering) because we believe it is a fantastic, fun, east to learn and flexible framework. We also choose this as the first (and possibly only) front-end framework for ethical reasons too. Also, we do not wish to support React (by Facebook) or Angular (by Google) for ethical reasons.
